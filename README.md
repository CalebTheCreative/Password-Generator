# Password-Generator

For this week's homework, we were asked to form a functioning password generator. We were given the HTML and CSS files, but needed to setup the JavaScript file to make it function.

## Installation

1) Create an array of each criteria (uppercase & lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters).

2) Create a prompt asking the user to decide what how many characters they'd like their password to be when they press the "Generate Password" button.

3) Proceed the prompt with questions confirming if the user would like to have uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters in their password.

4) Using the answers from the previous questions, create a function to randomly generate a password within the length of characters the user set.

5) Have random password displayed on screen.

## Usage

In order to use the application, press the button in the middle of the screen, titled "Generate Password". A series of questions will pop up for you to answer regarding your password length and criteria. As soon as you're finished answering, a password will appear on the screen.
